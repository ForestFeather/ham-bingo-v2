# ham-bingo-v2
Static version of ham radio bingo generator site for more broad utilization.

# Code Used
I would like to acknowledge with many thanks some other projects and resources that helped make this possible:
* HTML5 Boiletplate (https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) - Base site setup
* seedrandom.js (https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom) - a seeded random number generator for javascript
* Javascript bingo card generator (https://github.com/ktkaushik/bingo-card-generator) - for providing the base logic around bingo card generation in Javascript
* Pure CSS (https://purecss.io/) - For the ability to help lay out and make the page responsive.

# Many Thanks
Aside from the code used above, I also wish to thank my friends for putting up with my crazy ideas, listening to me rant as I work on this project, and encouraging me even when they have no idea what ham radio is.  Additionally, a huge thanks to the Stillwater Amateur Radio Association, because without them I'd never be a ham and this idea would never have been born.
